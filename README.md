## Technical Assessment â€“ Public Transport Data Explorer

### Objective

Build a web application that loads, analyses, and visualises public transport data using the HSL API. The application should present meaningful insights in an intuitive way.

### Tech Stack

- TypeScript
- React
- Sass with CSS Modules

### Requirements

- Fetch and display transport data from the HSL API.
- Implement an interactive UI to explore and analyse the data.
- Ensure a smooth user experience, including search, filtering, or other relevant features.
- Deploy the application and set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### Submission

- Provide a live deployment link and a GitHub repository.
- Include a README.md explaining your approach, challenges faced, and potential improvements.


## Features

- SASS modules
- FSD architecture
- Docker (nginx + react)
- CI/CD using GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment

## Plan and challenges
- Install GraphiQL + GraphiQL Explorer locally for the HSL endpoints exploration. Easier to query data because HSL (Digitransit) does not have a GraphiQL Explorer plugin installed in their GraphiQL interface.
- Research the data in HSL API to get the idea what to represent in the application.

- Design a prototype in Figma

- Backend is not specified in the assignment. I decided to add simple Express.js server because it is not safe to expose API tokens to the client. All the request should me made through the intermediate request from the backend.
